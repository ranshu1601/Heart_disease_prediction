# Heart Disease Analysis Model 

Using Logistic Regression 
[Data extracted from Kaggle] 

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install relevant libraries .

```bash
pip install sklearn
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
```
## Workflow
 Heart.csv (collecting dataset) -> Data Preprocessing -> Train Test Split -> Logistic Regression Model 

## For Testing
New data -> Trained Logistic Regression -> Healthy or Unhealthy 

## Sklearn 
Sklearn  contains a lot of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modelling including classification, Regression ,  Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction.

Model_selection : Is a method within Sklearn for setting a blueprint to analyze data then using to measure new data. 

Linear_Model : Is a class within sklearn which contains different functions for performance ML with linear model 

Metrics (Module) : Implements several loss score and utility functions to measure classification performance.
